# The Getaway - Plus!

This is a game initially created for a Software Engineering group project, it is now being expanded so that we have something to work on.

You play on a square/rectangular board, with the goal being to get to the goal tile while impeding your opponents progress with tile placement and action tiles.

There's a detailed How to Play section in the game if you want to know more.

**Permissions:**

     Feel free to use what you like, however crediting us (Can be found under @Author tags) would be nice.

     Some of the content (primarily music) is Copyrighted so we obviously can't give permission to use that.
     
     The content will be removed before a final release.

**Some notes on running:**

_To run without compiling_

    At the moment the project only works on IntelliJ, we are working on this

    Set folders "Assets" as Resources Root, "Source" as Sources Root and "Test" as Testing Root

_To get the main font correct:_ 

    Make sure that the filepath to the program doesn't include spaces
    Due to an issue with JavaFX 8 but we are working on a workaround
